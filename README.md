This repository contains the slides from my Habilitation à Diriger des Recherches (HDR) defense at the University of Western Brittany (Université de Bretagne Occidentale).

The HDR, or Habilitation to Direct, Manage, and Supervise Research, is the highest academic qualification in the French university system, recognizing a researcher’s ability to conduct independent research and supervise PhD students. It is an essential and equivalent requirement for attaining the status of Director of Research or Full Professor.

The HDR dissertation was reviewed and evaluated by a distinguished committee of experts. The official reviewers (rapporteurs) were Patrick Bas (Directeur de Recherche, HDR, CNRS), Marco Lorenzi (Chargé de Recherche, HDR, Centre Inria d’Université Côte d’Azur), and Roland Gautier (Professeur des Universités, HDR, Université de Bretagne Occidentale – Lab-STICC).

The jury was presided over by Nana Laurent (Professeur des Universités, HDR, Université de Bretagne Occidentale) and included Patrick Bas, Marco Lorenzi, Roland Gautier, Fernando Pérez-González (Full Professor, University of Vigo), Anca Christine Pascu (Maître de Conférences Emeritus, HDR, Université de Bretagne Occidentale), and Françoise Sailhan (Professeure des Universités, HDR, IMT Atlantique).

Field: Computer Engineering, Automation, and Signal Processing
Title: Deciphering the Realm of Artificial Intelligence Security: Journeying from Backdoor Attacks in Deep Learning to Safeguarding their Intellectual Property through Watermarking

The presentation summarizes a research journey through the evolving landscape of AI security, exploring adversarial and backdoor attacks, defense mechanisms, and intellectual property protection in deep learning models through watermarking techniques. It highlights theoretical advances, experimental frameworks, and practical implications for secure and trustworthy AI systems.
