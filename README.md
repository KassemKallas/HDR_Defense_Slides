This repository contains the presentation slides from my **Habilitation à Diriger des Recherches (HDR)** defense at the Université de Bretagne Occidentale (University of Western Brittany).

The **HDR (Habilitation à Diriger des Recherches)** is the highest academic qualification in the French university system. It formally recognizes a researcher’s ability to conduct independent, original research and to supervise doctoral students, and it is a mandatory and equivalent requirement for appointment as **Director of Research** or **Full Professor**.

The HDR dissertation was reviewed and evaluated by a distinguished committee of experts. The official reviewers (*rapporteurs*) were **Patrick Bas** (Directeur de Recherche, HDR, CNRS), **Marco Lorenzi** (Chargé de Recherche, HDR, Centre Inria d’Université Côte d’Azur), and **Roland Gautier** (Professeur des Universités, HDR, Université de Bretagne Occidentale – Lab-STICC).

The defense jury was chaired by Nana Laurent (Professeur des Universités, HDR, Université de Bretagne Occidentale) and included Patrick Bas, Marco Lorenzi, Roland Gautier, Fernando Pérez-González (Full Professor, University of Vigo), Anca Christine Pascu (Maître de Conférences Émérite, HDR, Université de Bretagne Occidentale), and Françoise Sailhan (Professeure des Universités, HDR, IMT Atlantique).

**Field:** Computer Engineering, Automation, and Signal Processing  

The presentation summarizes a long-term research trajectory in artificial intelligence security, covering adversarial and backdoor attacks in deep learning, robust defense strategies, and the protection of intellectual property through neural network watermarking. It highlights key theoretical contributions, experimental frameworks, and practical implications for the development of secure and trustworthy AI systems.
